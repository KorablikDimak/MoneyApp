# Family money app

## Description
An application project to calculate your budget. 
Orientation of family people for whom it is important to count their spending and plan for the future.

## Categories
Adding categories and items of expenses / income is called using the context menu by clicking the right mouse button.

## Table
The entry takes place in the table, which highlights expenses in 'red' and incomes in 'green'.
You can make edits yourself, delete lines. Any update of the table is accompanied by a daily update of 'statistics'.

### Capabilities
* Changing the date and entering data into the table for a specific date
* View charts reflecting the percentage of spending
  * View charts for any day you want
  * Collection of statistics for 7/30/365 days or for all time
* Sorting data in a table

## Logs
Full logging of the program.
To start logs, you need to place the configuration file in the directory '/ProjectName/bin/Debug/'.
And create folders in this directory 'logs' if it is not there.

## Future
The development of the project is possible.
In the future I will add the ability to select a user, for each of which there will be separate information. 
More detailed statistics with various infographics.
Improving the interface to make it more intuitive.
